# GitHub Repo Finder & Saver

This project is a simple web application where users can search for GitHub users' repositories, view them in a list, and save or remove them from a saved list. The app was created as a way for me to learn Solid.js as a beginner and for this project I followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/WDodWU-B-aY?si=KW9s8emXPtN0ZDPD) by Ebenezer Don.

## Features

- Search GitHub repositories: Users can search for repositories from any GitHub user.
- View repositories in a list: Repositories matching the user's search query are displayed in a list.
- Save and remove repositories: Users can save repositories to a local list and remove them when no longer needed.
- Local storage: The saved list is stored in the browser's localStorage, so it persists even after a page reload.

## Technologies

- Solid.js: Used for building the reactive user interface.
- Bootstrap: For simple styling and layout.
- GitHub API: Used to fetch repositories from GitHub users.
